  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    A friend of mine got this recipe while traveling in Italy. Chicken, mushrooms, and tortellini in rich cream
    sauce. Delicious! Serve sprinkled with parsley and cheese.
  </p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package refrigerated cheese tortellini</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>½ pound sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
    <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add tortellini. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
      tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken breast in hot oil until no
      longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in another skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic powder until mushrooms
      begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir heavy cream into mushrooms and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
      medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese, parsley, and salt.
      Continue to cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Stir tortellini and chicken into mushroom-cream sauce. Simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes. </li>
  </ol>
